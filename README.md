### This repository is being archived. I will not work further on it as I am not using LibSGD with Cerberus X anymore.

### libSGD2CX

libSGD2CX is a Python conversion script to create a Cerberus X module from the header files and libraries of the libSGD by Mark Sibly. Currently it works only under Windows.

libSGD2CX is licensed under the MIT license.

### Build instuctions for Windows.

* You will need to have Python installed. At least version 11.

* Copy the libSGD2CX.py file into the folder.

* CD to the release dir of LibSGD and call up the terminal.

* Build the module via ``Python libSGD2CX.py``

* Copy the module inside the cerberus/module_ext folder to a location, where your Cerberus X installation can find it.
